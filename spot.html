						   	This is my first website I wrote the HTML and CSS for. For this project, we were instructed to pick a website and redesign it to make it more up to date or design a website. I thought that it would be more beneficial for me to create a website that would begin my portfolio as a front end web developer. It allowed me to include information about myself as a person, as well as my knowledge of web development. <p />

						   	
						   	It took me a while to determine what kind of website I wanted to design. I looked online for ideas and found a collage of pictures that I wanted to use as my navigation bar and from that I changed it into what you see on my page now. I knew I wanted it to be simple but noticable and memorable. <p />
