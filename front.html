					  	   <div class="titleblock">what is front end web development</div>

						   Front End is the part of the web that you can see and interact with. It has two parts, web design and front end web development. So, as designers or front end web developers we have a working knowledge of Photoshop, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. <p />
						   
						   Simply, we can write code and create a website from scratch or we can use Photoshop and other design programs to do the design work to create a website. 
						  
						  

						   <div class="titleblock">references</div>

						   There are a few references I have used throughout learning about front end with Code Louisville. Even after you learn how to do front end web development, there is always something else to learn. That is one of many reasons I love front end, I will continue to learn throughout my career!

						   Here are some resources I found helpful:

						   <ul>

						   	   		<li>CSS Tricks</li>
									<li>Treehouse</li>
									<li>w3schools</li>
									<li>Creative Market</li>
									
							</ul>										
						   
							The first three of these references are websites that provide a vast amount of information for anything you can think of related to web development. The fourth reference is a great place to brainstorm and bounce ideas around when you want to figure out exactly what kind of project you would like to create. I always tell myself it is never too late to get help!
