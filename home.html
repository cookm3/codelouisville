						   Hi, my name is Marta Cook. I am a fun-loving, adventurous spirit who loves life, my siberian husky, and coffee. I am a firm believer in hard work, happiness, and laughter.  <p />
						   						 
						   						   
						   <div class="titleblock">a little about me</div>
						   
						   I am a graduate of Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green, KY. I completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in Interdisciplinary Studies with an emphasis in Organization and Communication of Ideas. <p />

						   After graduation, I applied for several jobs but nothing really stuck out to me that I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I want to have a job that I enjoy, not one that just brings in money. I thought a lot about what I have a passion for and then I heard about a program called Code Louisville. <p />

						   Code Louisville is a program for anyone who has the desire to learn about coding. I chose the Front End Web Development track because I really like being able to create something that others can see. After writing the code for a website, seeing the finished product is an amazing feeling. Luckily, what I have studied in this program was interesting for me and therefore easy to learn. I will say, my favorite part of web development is CSS! <p />

						   I created this website as the final project for my Code Louisville program, as well as a reference for prospective employers. <p />
