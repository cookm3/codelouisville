					  	   <div class="titleblock">Chartities</div>

					  	   These are two charities that are very special to me. First, I chose the American Cancer Society and St. Jude Children's Rsearch hospital because they hit very close to home. I had a relative pass away from cancer so I want to do anything I can to help the process of cancer research in any way I can. One day if we all keep trying I believe we will find a cure!  <p />

					  	   Since cancer has been in my life before I chose these two charities to share with you. If we all work together, we can make a difference in the world. <p />



					  	   <div class="titleblock">American Cancer Society</div>

						   The American Cancer Society has a vision of a cancer free world. They have been an organization for over 100 years working night and day to find a cure. The American Cancer Society has several support programs and services that are free to help families get through the process of beating cancer. This is just the beginning of what they do which is why I support them. <p />

						   <div class="titleblock">St. Jude Children's Research Hospital</div>
						   
						   St. Jude Children's Research Hospital serves families with kids that have cancer and other diseases. They treat and do their research under one roof, which provides the children with the best service around. One of the best parts about St. Jude is regardless of race, gender, ability to pay, etc. they help all children with cancer or any other disease. <p />
